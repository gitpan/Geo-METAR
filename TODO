                            METAR Wishlist

Following is a list of items that I'd like to add to METAR or that
others have requested. I've listed them here in the order that they're
likely to be completed.


  * Automatically find METAR data in an arbitrary data stream.

    Add a find() function to METAR that will look at a bunch of data
    and try to find the METAR data. Ideally, it would need no help
    from the user, but in thinking about it I think the user may have
    to supply a hint of some sort (like site code).


  * Move project to SourceForge.

    I've applied to do so, I just haven't received confirmation quite
    yet.


  * Apply remaining patches.

    A few patches remain in my INBOX. I've changed a lot in the
    process of applying the larger changes, so I'm going to hold off
    and apply some of the remaining changes manually after I'm sure
    nothing major has broken.


  * Improved the test suite.

    It'd be nice to have a lot of METARs which encompass various
    weather condition which we can test against.


  * International METAR support.

    Sites around the world use similar (but slightly different)
    formats for their METARs. I've had several requests to add support
    for parsing them properly as well.


  * Calculate Heat Index and/or Wind Chill

    Both would be fairly easy to do, provided you get the formulas
    correct.
        

If you'd like to submit a patch for any of these, please let me know!
Please put 'METAR' in the subject of your e-mail.
