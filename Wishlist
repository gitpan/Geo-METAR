			    METAR Wishlist

Following is a list of items that I'd like to add to METAR or that
others have requested. I've listed them here in the order that they're
likely to be completed.

Automatically find METAR data in an arbitrary data stream.

    Add a find() function to METAR that will look at a bunch of data
    and try to find the METAR data. Ideally, it would need no help
    from the user, but in thinking about it I think the user may have
    to supply a hint of some sort (like site code).


The End.
