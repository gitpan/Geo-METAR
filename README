BACKGROUND

    This is the README file for Geo::METAR.pm.

    The Geo::METAR home page is located at:
      http://www.wcnet.org/~jzawodn/perl/Geo-METAR/

    There may be bugs in the code as well as in the documentation. If
    you find either, I'd appreciate a patch or at least a mail message
    to let me know what's wrong.

    Geo::METAR as been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris as
    well as Windows NT. It may well work on other platforms. If you
    install it on another platform, I'd like to hear about it. If you
    develop patches for that platform, I'd REALLY like to hear about
    it. Send me a note. There's nothing that I know to be
    platform-dependent in here, but you never know.


INSTALLATION

    Installing Geo::METAR is an easy process.

      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make
      % make test
      % make install


DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation is built-in to the Geo::METAR module in POD
    format.  You can use any of the pod2* converters to translate it
    to a more readable format. The three most common formats are
    'man', 'html', and 'text'.

    When you ran the 'make install' above, documentation should have
    been installed on your system such that 'perldoc Geo::METAR' will
    spit it out.  Of course, you can run your favorite pod converter
    and generate it in alternative formats.


EXAMPLES

    The following scripts are included in the examples directory. They are
    provided as examples. What you do with them is your business.

      simple_dump.pl	       Process a simple METAR.
      fetch_temp.pl	       Fetch the temperature and print it out.


WISHLIST

    If you're wondering what will come next in Geo::METAR, see the
    Wishlist file in the distribution directory.
